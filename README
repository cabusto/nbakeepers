  
This uses Python 2.7. I really should update.

start with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To generate db, run python db_create.py

run these commands to set database location (I was using postgresql)
export DATABASE_URI="postgresql://localhost/nbakeepers"

run to set dev mode
export APP_SETTINGS="config.DevelopmentConfig"

to start server:
python manage.py runserver

config settings in config.py

  
If running in Nitrous.io:
Add postgress through autoparts

To start the server:
  $ parts start postgresql

To stop the server:
  $ parts stop postgresql

To connect to the server:
  $ psql
